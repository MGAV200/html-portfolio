<h1>The best movies according to Mateo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3> The Truman Show (8.2/10)</h3>
<p> The truman show is a movie that really makes you think about your reality, your world and your life. <br>
It is one of the saddest movies i've ever seen </p>

<h3> Fight Club (8.7/10)</h3>
<p> Fight Club is the movie that makes me wonder about our society,  more precisely, our 
    society of consumption</p>

<h3> Christopher Nolan movies (100000/10)</h3>
<p> Christopher Nolan is my favourite Director because he has the best ideas in terms of making a sci-fi 
    movie like <br> bro is a genius. The casting is always great, and the story is mind-blowing. But the thing 
    i like the most from him <br> is the originality he puts behind each movie for the notions of space and time. </p>
